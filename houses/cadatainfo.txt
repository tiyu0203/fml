S&P Letters Data
We collected information on the variables using all the block groups in California from the 1990 Census. In this sample a block group on average includes 1425.5 individuals living in a geographically compact area. Naturally, the geographical area included varies inversely with the population density. We computed distances among the centroids of each block group as measured in latitude and longitude. We excluded all the block groups reporting zero entries for the independent and dependent variables. The final data contained 20,640 observations on 9 variables. The dependent variable is ln(median house value).

The file cadata.txt contains all the the variables. Specifically, it contains median house value, median income, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, latitude, and longitude in that order.
